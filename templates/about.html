    <h1 class="mb-3">About Resource Portal</h1>
    <p>Welcome to <strong>Resource Portal</strong> — a centralized platform for students to access and share educational resources easily.</p>

    <h4 class="mt-4">Purpose</h4>
    <p>The portal is designed to help students find study materials, notes, and reference documents in one place. Teachers (admins) can upload verified resources to ensure high-quality content.</p>

    <h4 class="mt-4">Features</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Browse and search study resources by category.</li>
        <li>Upload resources (superusers only).</li>
        <li>User-friendly interface with secure login and registration.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="mt-4">Tech Stack</h4>
    <p>This project is built using <strong>Django</strong> (Python) for the backend, <strong>Bootstrap 5</strong> for styling, and <strong>SQLite</strong> as the database. It demonstrates basic CRUD operations, authentication, and file handling.</p>

    <p class="mt-3">This portal is a mini-project for academic purposes and can be extended to a full-fledged student resource management system in the future.</p>
